# Fruit-Recognition-using-Deep-Learning
I have used the Fruit -360 dataset which has a huge variety of fruits with around 90K + images. 
The link for the dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/moltean/fruits
It is a sequential model. The model is trained using tensorflow and saved it ain .h5 format.
